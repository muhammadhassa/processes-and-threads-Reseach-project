        <h1>Queues and Schedulers</h1>
        <p>Process scheduling allows the CPU to allocate a time schedule for each process and ensures that the CPU is active at all times while moving through different processes. Some operating systems can make use of Multiprogramming, such systems can allow multiple processes to be loaded into the executable memory at the same time.
		These processes share the CPU by using time multiplexing.</p>

		<p>The process scheduling queues are what the OS uses to group together all processes in the same execution state. They are unlinked and moved along to the next queue when their process state changes. The 3 most important process scheduling queues are explained below.</p> 
		<p>
		<b>1. Job queue</b><br>
		This queue keeps a set of all the processes in the system.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>2. Ready queue</b><br>
		This queue keeps a set of all processes ready and waiting to be executed in the main memory. New processes are placed into this queue.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>3. Device queue</b><br>
		This queue keeps processes which are waiting on a device which is currently blocked to become available.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<p>A scheduler is a type of system software that will enable the implementation of process scheduling. Schedulers largely are split into 3 different types explained below.</p>
		<b>1. Long Term Scheduler</b><br>
		Also known as a job scheduler, it serves the function of selecting the programs in ready state from the queue and loading them to memory for execution. It will also regulate the degree of multi-programming (the number of processes present in ready state at any given time). The main goal is to maximise efficiency by offering a carefully balanced mix of jobs including both I/O and CPU-bound processes.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>2. Medium Term Scheduler</b><br>
		This type of scheduler serves its main role in performing swapping, placing processes in and out of main memory to increase efficiency. If a process makes an I/O request, it can be suspended and will make no further progress towards being completed. These processes are placed back into secondary (disk) memory. It reduces the degree of multi-programming.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>3. Short Term Scheduler</b><br>
		This is also known as a CPU scheduler and has the goal of using set criteria to boost system performance. It helps to select one of a number of processes which are ready to execute and allocated the CPU to this process by way of a dispatcher.
