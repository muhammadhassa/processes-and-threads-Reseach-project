        <h1>Various States of a Process</h1>
		<img src="../imgs/Conor/process_state_diagram.png" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
		<p>
		<b>1. New</b><br>
		A new process is one which is about to be picked up by the Operating System into the main memory.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>2. Ready</b><br>
		After a process is created, it enters the ready state in which it is waiting for the CPU to be assigned.The OS will move the processes from secondary memory into main memory. Processes which are residing in the main memory and waiting to be assigned are said to be ready state processes. At any given time, there may be numerous processes waiting to be executed while present in the ready state.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>3. Running</b><br>
		Depending on whichever scheduling algorithm is being utilised, one of the ready state processes will be selected by the OS. If we have a single CPU in our system, only one of our processes can be run at any given time. If we have to access several processors, the equivalent number of processes can operate in the running state concurrently.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>4. Block or wait</b><br>
		Depending on the scheduling algorithm or the behaviour of the process, the running state may transition into a block or waiting state. The process then waits for input from the user or to be assigned a certain resource, meanwhile the CPU can be assigned to other processes.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>5. Completion or termination</b><br>
		The process which has finished its execution enters the completion state. At this point all the Process Control Block information saved on the process can be discarded and the OS can terminate the process.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>6. Suspend ready</b><br>
		A process in the ready state which needs to be moved back to secondary memory is said to be in the suspend ready state. This happens when there is a lack of necessary resources for the process to proceed, most often a lack of primary memory. If the main memory is full, it may push back a process to free up memory and make way for a higher priority process to execute.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>7. Suspend wait</b><br>
		Rather than suspending a ready process to make way for higher priority process, it is better to push a waiting process back to secondary memory. This is preferable as the waiting process is already idle while it waits for certain necessary resources to become available. Once these resources are available and the waiting state has finished, the waiting process can resume being executed by main memory. 
		</p>
