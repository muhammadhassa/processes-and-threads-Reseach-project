        <h1>speed</h1>
        <p>
		 In this part I will talk about mutiprocessing and multithreading,
		 giving the deatails about both eg adavantages disagvantages and detailig which one is better for speed.
        </p>
        <br>
		<h1>What is multiprossessing?</h1>
        <p>
		A multiprossessing system has more than two processors.CPUs are applied to the system, which aids in increasing the system's processing speed. 
		Each CPU has its own collection of registers as well as main memory.
        However, since each CPU is independent, it is possible that one CPU would be idle. 
		One processor may be idle, while the other is overburdened with the specific processes.
		In a caae like this,the process and the resources are shared dynamically among the processoers.
		<p/>
		<h1>what is multithreading?</h1>
		<p>
		multithreading is a program execution that allows a single process to have multiple code segments like threads.
		It also runs simultaneously within the process's "context." 
		Multi-threaded programs are those that execute two or more threads simultaneously. As a result, it is sometimes referred to as concurrency.
		<P/>
		<h1>The main Characteristics of Multiprocessing</h1>
		<ul>
      <li>multiprossessing is classified by the way memory is organised.</li>
      <li>It improves the reliabilty of the program.</li>
      <li>Multiprocessing Improves performance by decomposing a program into parallel tasks that are executable.</li>
         </ul>  
		 <h1>The main Characteristics of Multithreading</h1>
		<ul>
      <li>In a multithreading process each one of the threads run parallel to each other.</li>
      <li>multithreading saves memory as threads do not allow for the seperation of the memory area and this leads to a better application performance.</li>
         </ul>
