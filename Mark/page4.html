        <h1>Which One to Choose Over the Other (Google Chrome Example)</h1>
        <p>It is important for programmers to know which to pick between a processes and thread if they want
          to develop a program where the programmer wants to execute a lot of taks simultaneously. In the previous
          sections, I talked about the similarities and differences of processes and threads, as well as their
          advantages and disadvantages. In this section, I am going to discuss a real world example so you can get
          an idea of which one to use. The example I'm going to discuss is Google Chrome.
          <br>
          <br>
          During the development of Google Chrome, the developers needed to know how their program can manage different
          tasks that required communications, network and computer resources at the same time. A browser window or tab
          needs to communicate with several servers on the internet to be able to get text, audio, video, graphics, programs
          and other resources. The data retrieved is then rendered to display and interact with the user. The browser is deigned
          to also open many windows with each window having their own tasks.
          <br>
          <br>
          The developers of Google Chrome needed to decide how their program should manage those tasks. The developers designed
          the browser so that each window is a separate process rather than a single thread or multiple threads which are common
          with other browsers. This has proved beneficial to Google. As running each window as a separate process prevents the
          whole application from bugs and defects in the rendering engine and limits access from each rendering engine process
          to others and to the rest of the system. Separating a JavaScript program in a process stops it from consuming too much
          memory and time. This makes the whole browser non-responsive.
          <br>
          <br>
          Google made a well thought out compromise with the multi-processing architecture. As creating a new browser window
          creates a new process, there is a bigger fixed cost in memry and resources as opposed to using threads. The developers
          were expecting that their deisgn would result in less overall memory bloat.
          <br>
          <br>
          Using processes rather than threads also gives better memory usage when there is low memory. Operating systems would treat
          inactive windows as a low priority and becomes qualified to be swapped to disk when resources are more needed for other processes.
          The user active window is responsive because of this. If threads were used, it would be more difficult to isolate the unused and used
          memory efficiently which is a waste for both performance and memory.
          <br>
          <br>
          The image below shows google chrome processes running on Windows with several tabs open. As you can see, some are using
          a fair amount of CPU resources and time, and others using little. Each process has many threads running. For further reading
          on the design of Google Chrome with processes and threads, please refer to the References/Further Reading section of this page.
