        <h1>Advantages Of Threads</h1>
        <p>In this section, I will discuss about the advanatges of using threads compared to processes.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Unlike processes, context switching takes less time for threads which helps with management with
              task's time.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              One task after another are run without being guided. The threads in in the process are running
              in concurrency. The following figure shows a program with 3 threads running under a single CPU:
            </p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Threads make communication between threads and processes more efficient. With this, the process
              is manage more easily without using a tracker and reducing time costs.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Threads are used with multiprocessors. Multiprocessors offer more reliability compared to other
              processors. These multiprocessors when in use, responds to users periodically resulting in satisfaction
              for the user.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Disadvantages of Threads</h1>
        <p>In this section, I'm going to talk about the disadvantages of threads compared to processes.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Since resources are shared between threads like global variables and local variables. Security issues arise
              as global variables allow access to any process in the system.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Threads are not independent as they require the process and sytem to terminate. Processes also need threads to run
              and more time is used when the process is run with the threads.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            When threads are a dependency for an application, this can cause a problem where if a thread breaks, then
            the whole process is corrupted which can cause the application to crash. This commonly happens in applications
            that only use a single thread. Applications who use many threads can also cause problems where each thread
            crashes on each other which makes communication difficult.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The re-using of threads is not possible as it requires more hardware than software due to changes to the application
              from the base. As said earlier, processes are run with threads and these threads do not have their own separate memory space
              like processes do.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
